$checkout = new CheckoutApi($secretKey);


// Create a Card token
$card = new Card('4242424242424242', 12, 2020);
$card->cvv = 100;
$token = $checkout->tokens()->request($card);


// Create a payment method instance with card details
$method = new TokenSource($token->getId());

// Prepare the payment parameters
$payment = new Payment($method, 'GBP');
$payment->amount = 1000; // = 10.00
